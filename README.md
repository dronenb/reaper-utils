# True Cue
Set of Reascripts to create a more traditional style cue bus in REAPER. Essentially makes it so that soloing a track sends it post-fx to a bus entitled "CUE TRACK", which will not affect the master output (requires creating a fake "Master" track with solo defeat enabled). This eliminates problems when routing tracks through multiple buses prior to going to the "master" bus.

# Installation
For these ReaScripts to work, you must have [SWS](https://www.sws-extension.org/), [Ultraschall](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=214539), and [Julian Sader's js_ReaScriptAPI](https://github.com/juliansader/ReaExtensions/tree/master/js_ReaScriptAPI/) installed.
